# Orbital-NUSModuleMap

Proposed level of achievement: Vostok

Target audience: Students of NUS

Project Description:
NUSModuleMap is a website that aims to help students plan for their semester effectively and efficiently. No matter whether the student is taking a regular single major curriculum or any special programme such as a double degree curriculum or NOC, NUSModuleMap will be able to provide great assistance to the student in planning. 

Students will then no longer have to struggle to look for information online as to which programme they can participate in and go through the trouble to email various departments to decide which module can be mapped over. This makes academic planning much more manageable and it would give students much more confidence and certainty in the path that they take. They would also be exposed to many more options they can take based on the database of past study plans collected through pilot testing on a certain number of batch of students.

NUSModuleMap will consist of several features and they are listed below. 

Functionalities:
Huge database with information on all the programmes within NUS, both regular programmes and special programmes.
Recommendations for students based on the programme that they are taking which the website will require as a query. The recommendations presented are based on study plans of past year students who took a similar track. 
The recommendations will be presented to the student in the form of a scrollable list. It will be sequenced based on the peer ratings of the study plan, from the highest to lowest. 
After viewing the study plan, the student will be given the opportunity to rate the study plan as well, giving it a +1/0/-1.  

Tech Stack:
HTML for website structure
CSS for website design
Javascript for functionalities
